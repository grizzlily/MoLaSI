                <p>In Great Britain Christmas is the biggest holiday a year. Catholic Christmas is celebrated on
                    December 25. Usually everyone gathers in the family circle, decorates the house, Christmas tree,
                    hangs stockings over the fireplace, and mistletoe over the doorway. Lighting deer and Santa Claus
                    figurines appear on the lawns near the houses, beautiful lights glow the walls and roofs. <br><br>
                    Christmas in England is celebrated for 12 days until January 5th. <br><br>
                    Christmas is a day off, that is, on these days the streets seem to die out, because all
                    institutions, shops and schools are closed, public transport and taxi services do not work, as well.

                <img class="pic" src="img/history.png" alt="History">
                <p>The word <strong>Christmas</strong> comes from the Old English phrase <strong>'Cristes
                        Maesse'</strong> - <em>the Mass of Christ</em>. There is also a shortened version of this word,
                    <strong>Xmas</strong>, which began to be used in the mid-16th century (the first letter of the name
                    of Christ in Greek coincides <strong>with the Latin letter X</strong>). <br><br>
                    The history of Christmas in England has its roots in the deep past. The first written references to
                    the fact that the holiday was celebrated on December 25 belong to 336 AD. At that time, the first
                    Christian emperor Constantine ruled in Rome.

                <div class="textAndPic wrap">
                    <p><strong>There are several theories and legends of the origin of the Christmas tree:</strong> <br>
                        <br>
                        1. There is a legend about the baptizer of Germany, St. Boniface, who decided to prove to the
                        pagans that the oak they worshiped does not have magical power, and cut it down. Falling, the
                        oak felled all the trees around it, and only a small spruce remained standing. "May it be a tree
                        of Christ!" - exclaimed the saint. Allegedly, since then, decorated Christmas trees have been
                        placed in houses for Christmas. <br> <br>
                        2. There is the story about the German reformer Martin Luther, who in 1513, returning home on
                        Christmas Eve, was enthusiastic by the beauty of the stars that were shining all over the sky,
                        so that it seemed as if the tops of the trees were glowing with stars. At home, he put a
                        Christmas tree on the table and decorated it with candles, and on top he put a star in memory of
                        the star of Bethlehem, which showed the way to the cave where Jesus was born. <br> <br>
                        3. German historian Alexander Demant claims that the first Christmas tree was displayed in
                        Strasbourg Cathedral in Germany in 1539.
                        But what we can say for sure is that the tradition of putting up and decorating a Christmas tree
                        came from Germany, which then spread all over the world.

                    <p>There were two attempts to popularize the Christmas tree. <br><br>
                        • First attempt: In 1800, King George III and his German wife Charlotte decorated the first
                        Christmas tree. <br><br>
                        • The second time the Christmas tree was decorated in England was only in 1840 by Queen
                        Victoria’s husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg. <br><br>
                        But, despite the origin of the Christmas tree from Germany, Great Britain began to popularize it
                        worldwide, massively spreading this tradition throughout all its colonies. <br><br>
                        For example, the Illustrated London News in 1848 published a picture of Queen Victoria, Prince
                        Albert and their children standing near a Christmas tree. It was a role model for everyone else.
                        <br><br>
                        Prince Albert and Queen Charlotte were Germans, so the tradition of decorating the Christmas
                        tree was brought to the West by the Germans.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>According to the German tradition, the Christmas tree was decorated with gingerbread, nuts and
                    apples. <br><br>
                    !!! From 1947 to this day, Norway has traditionally given Britain a huge Christmas tree, which at
                    Christmas is installed in London's main square, Trafalgar Square. This is a gesture to honor
                    Anglo-Norwegian cooperation during the Second World War.</p> <br>

                    <p>The Christian Saint Nicholas, the English Father Christmas, Scandinavian folklore characters and
                        pagan gods - all of them were prototypes of the modern image of Santa Claus. He was often
                        depicted as a giant elf, forest spirit, or religious figure. It was in American culture that the
                        image of Santa Claus originated, and then other countries borrowed it or created their own
                        variations. Already at the beginning of the 20th century, Santa had the main features of his
                        image: a white beard, a casing and gifts for children. <br><br>
                        А big role in popularizing the modern Santa Claus was played by the Coca-Cola company, which
                        created an advertisement for soda with the image of Santa Claus, a kind and cheerful grandfather
                        in a red outfit.</p>

                    <p>The very word advent comes from the Latin adventus, which means "coming", so the advent calendar
                        counts the time remaining until Christmas. <br> <br>
                        The sale of advent calendars starts in Britain at the beginning of December. They are usually
                        made in the form of a cardboard house with windows that you can open every day to Christmas.
                        Sweets, a note, a small gift, etc. are placed in each window. In recent years, advent calendars
                        are not only with sweets, but also with cosmetics, jewelry and even accessories.</p>

                <p>Christmas cards are pretty popular in Great Britain. Since the 19th century they have become
                    popular to send Christmas cards – instead of personal congratulations. More than one billion
                    cards are sent out every year before Christmas in a country with a population of 60 million.
                </p>
                <img class="minipic" src="img/first card.jpg" alt="Christmas cards">
                <p><strong>First Christmas card</strong> was invented by Sir Henry Cole, a British civil
                    servant. <br><br>
                    Story began with the <strong>writer Charles Dickens</strong> which, in 1843, published the
                    story-tale <strong>"A Christmas Carol"</strong>, which actually started the commercial
                    celebration of Christmas. Inspired, Cole asked his illustrator friend John Horsley to design
                    a fun card to give to family and friends.</p>

                <img class="minipic" src="img/pantomime.png" alt="Pantomimes">
                <p>The biggest Christmas tradition is essentially a theatrical production of traditional fairy tales
                    such as Jack and the Beanstalk or Cinderella. Pantomimes are aimed at families with children and are
                    performed by little-known celebrities. <br><br>
                    Usually in these skits there is a woman (played by a man dressed as a woman) who plays a comical
                    role in the show. In the story, she is often the friend of the main character and supports him in a
                    competition against a cunning villain. Every time a villain appears, the audience is encouraged to
                    join in his ridicule, booing and hissing.</p>
